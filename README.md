# Debugging the DnD puzzle game


### To Start I made the puzzle peices in the pussle peices box change respectively to the background imahges when they were changing on clicking on the thumbnails at the bottom.


### 2nd I gave the reset button a functionality to reset the board when ever there were images in the dropzone.

### 3rd I made sure that the images don't stack in the drop zone when i put more than one image in same zone instead they go back to there puzzle box

### 4th  I made the thumbnail images reset the board by nesting functions so they also reset the board
